link:https://snort.org/[Snort] is an open source network intrusion prevention system (IPS) by Cisco. It is capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP networks. It can perform protocol analysis, content searching and matching, and detect a variety of attacks and probes. Snort can be used as a straight packet sniffer like tcpdump, a packet logger (useful for network traffic debugging), or as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system.
